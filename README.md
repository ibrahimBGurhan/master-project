**DETECTION AND MONITORING OF ALGORITHMIC BIAS ON FACE RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS**

aExtensive usage of AI algorithms in sectors like financial institutions, engineering, medical research, online and network security, smart homes have made the lifestyle of humans much easier, however, strong dependency on AI can sometimes become troublesome due to algorithmic bias. This bias causes unexpected inconveniences, loss of resource, data or even permanent damage to the AI integrated system. Algorithmic bias is referred as the lack of fairness emerging from the output of AI system. Lack of fairness has several types and often summarized as one-group discrimination which is mainly based on some specific distinction of categories. In this paper the algorithmic bias, its types and effects are discussed with sufficient details and an evaluation of bias on a popular AI application known as face recognition is presented through necessary machine learning techniques. Basically, a face recognition problem extracted from an open-source dataset repository (Kaggle) is solved here and effect of algorithmic bias as evaluated by fitting different AI models are presented with reference to relevant data science concepts.
